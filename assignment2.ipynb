       " 'text': 'First & most offensive: they reek of gasoline so if you are sensitive/allergic to petroleum products like I am you will want to pass on these.  Second: the phone adapter is useless as-is. Mine was not drilled far enough to be able to tighten it into place for my iPhone 12 max. It just slipped & slid all over. Stupid me putting the adapter together first without picking up the binoculars to smell them bc I wasted 15 minutes trying to figure out how to put the adapter together bc it does not come with instructions!  I had to come back here to the website which was a total pain. Third: the tripod is also useless. I would not trust the iOS to hold my $1600 phone nor even a Mattel Barbie for that matter. It’s just inefficient for the job imo.  Third: in order to try to give an honest review I did don gloves & eyewear to check the binoculars out.  They seemed average except for mine seemed to be missing about 10% of the film costing in the lower edge of one of the lenses which would have ruined every video & photograph unplanned to take so for me these are a very huge hard pass.  I expect the accessories that come with the main product to be as good or better than the product I’m buying. Otherwise I would just buy the product as a stand alone.  Sadly, I found a decent pair of binoculars last year with a much better quality phone adapter & tripod, but they had a defect too.  Guess I’m going to have to pay more.  Ugh.',\n",
